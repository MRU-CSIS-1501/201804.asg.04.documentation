# Assignment 04

## Challenge: Parade Card Game Simulator

### Preamble

[Parade](https://www.zmangames.com/en/products/parade/) is an odd card game by Naoki Homma and is distributed by Z-Man games in North America. One of the more interesting things about this game is the "parade" itself: a line of cards that the players add to during their turn.

When a player adds a card to the parade, a number of things have to happen, based on small set of rules. This part of the game can be quite confusing to new players.

You should read the parts about adding to a parade on pages 2 and 3 of the instructions. (They are included in this Github repo.)

### What you're going to build

In this assignment, you will create an app that will explain to the user what happens when a given card is added to a given parade.

There are quite a few helper classes I've provided for you. Documentation and usage examples for each one are provided later. Not reading these would be A Bad Idea of Epic Proportions.

Some example runs follow.

**Example Run 1:**

> Commentary on Run 1
>
> After starting the app, you can see the following things:
>
> - a welcome banner (you can make this look however you like)
> - a series of colored boxes representing the cards in the starting parade (which always has 6 cards). Each card has its value (from 0 to 10) in the top right corner and a character representing its color in the bottom left corner. You will need to use methods from the `ParadeDisplayHelper` to show this.
> - a menu that gives you 3 choices. Your menu must have the same choices in the same order.
> - a prompt ('Your choice? ')
>
> In this particular example, we see that the user chose to quit and was given a cheesy parting message. You can change the message, but there should be one.

**Example Run 2:**

> Commentary on Run 2
>
> Here we explore the first menu item a bit with some "normal" valid input:
>
> - the first time, we ask for a parade of size 1 and we get a parade of size 1 back
> - the menu comes back again (_do I sense a loop?!?_) and this time we choose a parade of size 12
> - that darn menu is back again

**Example Run 3:**

> Commentary on Run 3
>
> Here we see what happens with invalid input at the main menu. Notice that the main menu only accepts the numbers 1 through 3. Anything else (numbers out of range, letters, blank entries, doubles) all print a warning and then re-prompt.

### Notes

- In order to handle the problem of a user entering a non-integer, typically we can go one of two routes here:

  - use Scanner's `hasNextInt` method, or
  - use String's `matches` method

  Either way is acceptable for this assignment.

- Solutions to this problem that you find online to this problem are going about it **very** differently from what we're doing here.
- To help you reach your solution, write down a number of examples of different sizes. This will help you understand what steps are going to be needed to create the table.
- Handling the binary calculation of the surviving person might seem intimidating...until you look in the Integer API. There are two methods that make this part of the assignment delightfully straightforward. (This is a good lesson...knowing your common APIs is an insanely valuable skill.)
