# Assignment 04

## Challenge: Parade Card Game Simulator

### Preamble

[Parade](https://www.zmangames.com/en/products/parade/) is an odd card game by Naoki Homma and is distributed by Z-Man games in North America. One of the more interesting things about this game is the "parade" itself: a line of cards that the players add to during their turn.

When a player adds a card to the parade, a number of things have to happen, based on small set of rules. This part of the game can be quite confusing to new players.

You should read the parts about adding to a parade on pages 2 and 3 of the instructions. (They are included in this Github repo.)

### What you're going to build

In this assignment, you will create an app that will explain to the user what happens when a given card is added to a given parade.

Some example runs follow.

**Example Run 1:**

> - We see the beauty.

**Example Run 2:**

<pre>
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>x</b>
Not an integer.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>3.14</b>
Not an integer.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>0</b>
That's not greater than 0.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>4</b>

|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|: 4 dies
|●|○|x|○|: 3 dies
|●|○|○|○|: 1 survives

The final survivor should be at position 1.

Do another run? <b>n</b>
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 2
>
> This run shows you that when invalid data is entered, the user is pestered until they enter something correctly.

**Example Run 3:**

<pre>
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? 2

|●|●|: start
|●|x|: 2 dies
|●|○|: 1 survives

The final survivor should be at position 1.

Do another run? y
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? -2
That's not greater than 0.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? 5

|●|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|●|: 4 dies
|x|○|●|○|●|: 1 dies
|○|○|●|○|x|: 5 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|: 3 survives

The final survivor should be at position 3.

Do another run? yes
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? 9

|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|: 4 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|: 6 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|: 8 dies
|x|○|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|: 1 dies
|○|○|●|○|x|○|●|○|●|: 5 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|○|●|○|x|: 9 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|○|x|○|○|: 7 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|○|○|○|○|: 3 survives

The final survivor should be at position 3.

Do another run? arglebargle
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 3
>
> - Another run occurs if `y` or `yes` (both case insensitive) is entered.
> - Another run won't occur if anything other than y/yes is entered.

### Notes

- In order to handle the problem of a user entering a non-integer, typically we can go one of two routes here:

  - use Scanner's `hasNextInt` method, or
  - use String's `matches` method

  Either way is acceptable for this assignment.

- Solutions to this problem that you find online to this problem are going about it **very** differently from what we're doing here.
- To help you reach your solution, write down a number of examples of different sizes. This will help you understand what steps are going to be needed to create the table.
- Handling the binary calculation of the surviving person might seem intimidating...until you look in the Integer API. There are two methods that make this part of the assignment delightfully straightforward. (This is a good lesson...knowing your common APIs is an insanely valuable skill.)
