## Overview

This assignment has 1 challenge - you are being asked to create a single application of non-trivial size. This will be the standard going forward in this course as well as your future programming courses in the program. Welcome to the big leagues.

## Suggestions for a plan of attack

Starting a major assignment can feel overwhelming...where do you start?!?

Here are my suggestions.

- foo
- bar
- bax

## Running tests

- Run the automated output tests using `make tests`
- Run the automated style tests using `make style -i`

## WARNING!

You will want to get started on this right away.

You know by now from your experiences in the last 3 assignments that programming is a time-consuming (nay, a time-_devouring_) process. To make matters more interesting, you are now entering the time of a semester when numerous things (often of significant weight) are coming due in your other courses and it's very easy to feel overwhelmed.

Persevere - you can get through this, as have others before you.
